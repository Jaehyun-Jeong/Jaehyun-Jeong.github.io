## 👋 Hi, I’m Jaehyun Jeong

I am a graduate of the Department of Applied Mathematics at Kongju National University, driven by a deep interest in reinforcement learning, intelligent agents, and the intersection of theory and real-world impact.

Currently, I am passionate about building interpretable, context-aware RL agents and exploring the biological foundations of intelligence through AI. I seek to continue this journey where artificial agents can make meaningful decisions—beyond performance metrics.
