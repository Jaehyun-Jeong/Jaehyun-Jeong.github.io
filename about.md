## 👋 Hi, I’m Jaehyun Jeong

I am a graduate of the Department of Applied Mathematics at Kongju National University, driven by a deep interest in reinforcement learning, intelligent agents, and the intersection of theory and real-world impact.

My academic journey started with foundational mathematics such as Linear Algebra, Calculus, and Probability Theory, which I studied not just as tools but as languages to reason about learning. Later, I transitioned into applied work through self-study of machine learning, reinforcement learning, and deep learning. During this time, I built various models from scratch including DQN, A2C, and REINFORCE, and explored the role of memory and reward interpretation in agent behavior.

I also participated in diverse research and competitions:
- Developed a CNN–biLSTM–attention model in the AnDi Challenge
- Built insulin injection and food recommendation agents using lightweight, neural-free RL
- Created educational tools like Decision Tree visualizations using the `manim` library
- Placed in national data science and price forecasting competitions
- Worked on child education methodologies and custom AI environments

During my exchange at Yamaguchi University in Japan, I redefined RL problems and contributed to course improvement by debugging existing code. These experiences shaped my belief that reinforcement learning is not just optimization, but a framework for designing agents that reason, adapt, and interpret dynamic goals and contexts.

Currently, I am passionate about building interpretable, context-aware RL agents and exploring the biological foundations of intelligence through AI. I seek to continue this journey where artificial agents can make meaningful decisions—beyond performance metrics.
